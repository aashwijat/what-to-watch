What-2-Watch : Movie and Series Selector

Implemented using Python, Tkinter and the Random module, with basic concepts of lists and Functions. This is a basic automation project to automate decision making. The What-To-Watch App allows users to Select Genre and obtain a randomly generated option from pre-defined lists. It also allows users to add new movies and shows into the list.

In future updates, this application can be further improved by connecting the source-code with an RDBMS and keeping a track on the status, i.e watch, watching and watched. Doing so would also ensure that the new options added in the 'To Watch' field is permanently stored in the relations.

I believe this project allowed me to test-waters with the basics of automation, while helping me strengthen my foundations in the same.
